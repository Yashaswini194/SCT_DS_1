# SCT_DS_1 – Data Visualization Task

This repository contains **Task 1** of the SkillCraft Technology Data Science Internship.

## 📌 Objective
To analyze and visualize book rating data using Python and understand the distribution of ratings across different categories.

## 📊 Dataset
The dataset used contains information about books and their ratings.  
The data was cleaned and analyzed to identify how book ratings are distributed.

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies
- Python  
- Pandas  
- Matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook  

## 📈 Visualization
